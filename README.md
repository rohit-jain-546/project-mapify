🗺️ MAPIFY

Route Finder Web Application using Mapbox API

Mapify is a web-based route visualization application built using Flask and Mapbox API.
The application allows users to input two locations and view the route between them on an interactive map.

The project includes a basic authentication system backed by MySQL, developed locally using XAMPP, and is deployed on Railway for public access.

This project was developed as a first web development project, focusing on API integration, backend–frontend connectivity, and database-backed authentication.
